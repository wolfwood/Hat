The Hat tools are distributed under the terms of the licence
detailed below.  If you link the Hat tools with the gtk+ library
'glib', you should know that 'glib' is governed by the LGPL.

Some code from the libraries is copied directly from the
Haskell hierarchical libraries base package, which is
  (c) copyright the University of Glasgow, 2001-2004
and was originally distributed under a separate BSD-style licence.


LICENCE
-------
Definition: "this software" = any software which is distributed under
                              the conditions of this licence.
            "small number of modules" = less than 10% of any one program

It is the intention that this software be "freely available" in the Gnu
(http://www.gnu.org/) and Open Source (http://www.opensource.org/)
traditions.  The following is a brief statement of the rights and
restrictions attached to this software distribution.  This is version
2 of the licence, and governs this copy of the software.  We may
publish modified terms and conditions at a later date, and if you
wish, you may apply any successor licence (when published), or the
GNU GPL, to this software as an alternative to the current terms.
(Note that if you convert your copy of the licence to the GPL, you
will not be able to convert it back later, and nor can anyone who
receives a copy from you.)

If you are not sure about any of the terms of this licence, please
contact us to discuss your requirements.  (Primary contact:
Malcolm.Wallace@cs.york.ac.uk)

You may use, re-distribute, and modify this software, in whole or
in part, in source or binary form, but you must include without
alteration all the relevant copyright notices.  (You may of course
remove a copyright notice pertaining to a piece of software no longer
included in your distribution.)  You may add your own additional
copyright notices for any modifications or additions to this software
that you distribute.  If you distribute a modified version, you must
also provide corresponding source code for it; any modifications must
be described in the documentation; and you must clearly indicate that
the software has been modified, for instance by changing the name of
the executable or its version number, or by some other method.

You must not restrict anyone else's rights to use, re-distribute
or modify this software.  Distributions of standard or modified
versions of any part of this software must retain this licence (or
its successor), or at your choice, be distributed instead under the
GNU GPL.

In addition, you are explicitly granted the right to re-use a small
number of modules of this software in the creation of a new program
which does not perform substantially the same task as this software,
for instance, by re-using a parser but not the entire compiler.
In such a case, you are not forced to place the new software under
this or any other licence, but you must ensure that:
 . you clearly acknowledge which code you have re-used from this software,
 . you retain the relevant copyright notices, and
 . if you distribute the new software, you indicate to recipients where
   they can freely obtain a standard copy of this original software.

Object files, intermediate files, and trace files, produced as output by
this software, do not fall under this copyright statement and are not
governed by the terms of this licence.  You are free to use them (or
restrict their use) as you like.  However, the inclusion of Hat's
runtime system (libHSHat.a) in a resulting executable, means that you
may not distribute that executable except under the terms of this
licence.  (We can't see any reason why anyone would want to distribute a
traced version of their program anyway - but if this is a problem for
you, contact us.  Also, you should check carefully the licence of any
other library you use in your traced program, whether supplied together
with this software or not.)


UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING, THIS SOFTWARE IS SUPPLIED "AS IS"
AND WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT
LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  NEITHER THE AUTHORS, COPYRIGHT HOLDERS, NOR ANY
OTHER PARTY WHO REDISTRIBUTES THIS SOFTWARE SHALL BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES,
HOWSOEVER CAUSED, ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE.  USE AT YOUR
OWN RISK.
