The short version is:

  $ ./configure   [ --prefix=/my/installation ]  [ --buildwith=xhc-4.32 ]
  $ make
  $ make install

which provides you with all the components of Hat in /usr/local,
[or in /my/installation if you used the --prefix= option].  If you
want slightly more control, try

  $ make help

which will give you a list of individual build targets.

System requirements:

The build requires GNU make and a C compiler (usually gcc) together
with the usual tools of the UNIX environment, such as sh, ar, sed, etc.
You also need a host Haskell compiler, and in particular, write-access
to its package directories.
