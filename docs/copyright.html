<p>
Development of the Hat tracing system was mainly funded by the UK's
Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, grant number
EPSRC GR/M81953.  The University of York, University of Kent, RWTH
Aachen, and Microsoft Research (Cambridge) also contributed.

<p>
The Hat system as a whole was developed (mainly) at, and is copyright
&copy; The University of York, 1996-2005.

<p>
The <em>hat-trans</em> tool is partly based on the front end of the
<em><a href="http://haskell.org/nhc98">nhc98</a></em> compiler, and
those parts are copyright &copy; Niklas R&ouml;jemo, 1991-1998.
Parts are also based on earlier work on tracing transformations,
copyright &copy; Jan Sparud and Colin Runciman, 1996-1997.

The Hat tools are distributed under the terms of the
licence detailed below.  If you link the Hat tools with the <a
href="http://www.gtk.org/">gtk+</a> library <em>glib</em>, you should
know that <em>glib</em> is governed by the LGPL.

<p>
Some code from the libraries is copied directly from the
Haskell hierarchical libraries base package, which is
&copy; copyright the University of Glasgow, 2001-2004
and was originally distributed under a separate BSD-style licence.

<h3>LICENCE</h3>
</center>
<p>
<b>Definition:</b>
<ul>
<li> "this software" = any software which is distributed under
                              the conditions of this licence.
<li> "small number of modules" = less than 10% of any one program
</ul>

<p>
It is the intention that this software be "freely available" in the Gnu
(<a href="http://www.gnu.org/"><tt>http://www.gnu.org/</tt></a>)
and Open Source
(<a href="http://www.opensource.org/"><tt>http://www.opensource.org/</tt></a>)
traditions.
The following is a brief statement of the rights and restrictions
attached to this software distribution.  This is version 2 of the
licence, and governs this copy of the software.  We may publish
modified terms and conditions at a later date, and if you wish, you
may apply any successor licence (when published), or the GNU GPL,
to this software as an alternative to the current terms.  (Note that
if you convert your copy of the licence to the GPL, you will not be
able to convert it back later, and nor can anyone who receives a copy
from you.)

<p>
If you are not sure about any of the terms of this licence,
please contact us to discuss your requirements.  (Primary contact:
Malcolm.Wallace@cs.york.ac.uk)

<p>
You may use, re-distribute, and modify this software, in whole or
in part, in source or binary form, but you must include without
alteration all the relevant copyright notices.  (You may of course
remove a copyright notice pertaining to a piece of software no longer
included in your distribution.)  You may add your own additional
copyright notices for any modifications or additions to this software
that you distribute.  If you distribute a modified version, you must
also provide corresponding source code for it; any modifications must
be described in the documentation; and you must clearly indicate that
the software has been modified, for instance by changing the name of
the executable or its version number, or by some other method.

<p>
You must not restrict anyone else's rights to use, re-distribute or
modify this software.  Distributions of standard or modified versions
of this software must retain this licence (or its successor), or at
your choice, be distributed instead under the GNU GPL.

<p>
In addition, you are explicitly granted the right to re-use a small
number of modules of this software in the creation of a new program
which does not perform substantially the same task as this software,
for instance, by re-using a parser but not the entire compiler.
In such a case, you are not forced to place the new software under
this or any other licence, but you must ensure that:
<ul>
 <li> you clearly acknowledge which code you have re-used from this software,
 <li> you retain the relevant copyright notices, and
 <li> if you distribute the new software, you indicate to recipients where
      they can freely obtain a standard version of this original software.
</ul>

<p>
Object files, intermediate files, and trace files, produced as output
by this software do not fall under this copyright statement and are
not governed by the terms of this licence.  You are free to use them
(or restrict their use) as you like.  However, the inclusion of
Hat's runtime system (libHSHat.a) in a resulting executable, means
that you may not distribute that executable except under the terms
of this licence.  (We can't see any reason why anyone would want to
distribute a traced version of their program anyway - but if this
is a problem for you, contact us.  Also, you should check carefully
the licence of any other library you use in your traced program,
whether supplied together with this software or not.)


<p>
UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING, THIS SOFTWARE IS SUPPLIED "AS IS"
AND WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT
LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  NEITHER THE AUTHORS, COPYRIGHT HOLDERS, NOR ANY
OTHER PARTY WHO REDISTRIBUTES THIS SOFTWARE SHALL BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES,
HOWSOEVER CAUSED, ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE.  USE AT YOUR
OWN RISK.
