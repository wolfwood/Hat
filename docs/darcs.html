  <h1>Developer access to Hat</h1>
</center>
<hr>

<p>
This page tells you how to get <a href="http://darcs.net">darcs</a>
access to the latest, most current, <em>Hat</em> sources.


<h3>Viewing the darcs repository on the web</h3>
<p>
If you don't want to download the sources, you can view the current
contents of the repository on the web
<a href="http://darcs.haskell.org/darcsweb/">here</a>.


<h3>Remote Read-only Access</h3>

<p>
Read-only access is available to anyone - there's no need to ask us
first.  To get read-only access to the repository:

<ul>
<li> Obviously, you need to have the <em>darcs</em> command installed.
<li> <tt>darcs get --partial http://darcs.haskell.org/hat</tt>
<li> If you want the complete history, omit the <tt>-partial</tt> flag,
     but be warned that the history is large, it will take a long time
     to download, and will have errors on case-insensitive file systems
     (e.g. Windows and MacOS X).
<li> The checked-out source tree will appear in a directory called
     <tt>hat</tt>.  You can rename this directory to whatever you
     like, darcs won't mind.
<li> Change to that directory, and run the shell script <tt>sh start</tt>.
     This will prepare the repository for use, by making various scripts
     executable, possibly downloading extra library packages, and so on.
<li> From then on, you can keep up with new changes in the central repo
     by using <tt>darcs-all pull</tt>.  You can even do your own
     development in a detached fashion, using <tt>darcs record</tt> on
     your own local repository.
</ul>

<p>
With read-only CVS access you can do anything except commit changes
to the central repository.  You can <tt>darcs record</tt> changes
in your local tree, then submit them to us by email using <tt>darcs
send</tt>.


<h3>Using the checked-out tree</h3>

<p>
The first thing to do after checking out a fresh tree is
<tt>sh start</tt>, followed by
<tt>./configure</tt>, and setting whatever options you wish to use.
It is always safe to re-run the <tt>./configure</tt> script at any
time - it will never leave your configuration in an inconsistent state.
The machine/OS combination is always detected first so you can't re-use
the wrong machine configuration by mistake, and although previous
options for a particular machine are cached, they are always reported,
and can be always overridden on the command line.

<p>
Then, do a <tt>make</tt> with whatever targets you are interested
in: <tt>make help</tt> will give you a list of the common ones.
For instance, <tt>make hat</tt> gives you everything, but <tt>make
hat-tools</tt> gives you just the browsing tools.


<h3>Tracking changes in the central repository</h3>
<p>
The log messages of all accepted darcs patches are currently sent to the
mailing list <tt>cvs-nhc98@haskell.org</tt>.  If you wish to see who
is making changes, why, and and what they say about them, please do
join this list - see <a href="http://haskell.org/mailman/listinfo">
<tt>http://haskell.org/mailman/listinfo</tt></a> for further details.


<h3>Core developers - write-access to the central repository</h3>
<p>
Core developers of <em>hat</em> have write-access to the central
darcs repository.  All you need is an account on the machine
<tt>darcs.haskell.org</tt>.

<ul>
<li> You need to have <em>ssh</em> (secure shell) installed.
<li> The first time you commit a patch back to the repo, you will
     need to specify where it is located:
    <pre>darcs push darcs..haskell.org:/home/darcs/hat</pre>
<li> Thereafter, just use <tt>darcs push</tt> to commit patches.
</ul>

<p>
All the other instructions are the same.

<h3>Gaining write-access</h3>
<p>
To obtain write-access to darcs.haskell.org, you need to ask the
haskell.org maintainers - Simon Marlow &lt;simonmar@haskell.org&gt; or
Isaac Jones &lt;ijones@galois.com&gt; - for an account.
