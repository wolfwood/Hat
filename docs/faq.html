<h3>Why do you call Hat a <em>tracer</em> rather than a <em>debugger</em>?</h3>

<p>
The word <em>debugger</em> suggests: firstly that there is a fault to be
found; and secondly, that the tool will fix it.  In actual fact, the
tracer is just a tool for observing what happened in any particular
program run.  You can use it to find the cause of a fault, but equally,
you can use it simply to aid your understanding of a correct program.
While the tracer will help you to find bugs, it cannot find them for
you.  And once the bug is found, <em>you</em> must fix it, the tracer
cannot!

<h3>Why did you not implement a conventional tracer/debugger as they
are well known for imperative languages?</h3>

<p>
Conventional tracers (debuggers) for imperative languages allow the
user to step through the program computation, stop at given points
and examine variable contents.  In our opinion this tracing method is
unsuitable for a lazy functional language such as Haskell, because its
evaluation order is complex, function arguments are usually unwieldy
large unevaluated expressions, and generally computation details do
not match the user's high-level view of functions mapping values
to values.  Also the stack used by the Haskell runtime system does
not resemble the stack of function calls used by runtime systems of
strict languages.

<p>
However, the trace file written by the traced program contains all
information in the order of lazy evaluation. It is possible to write
a viewing tool that admits single stepping through a lazy computation.

<h3>How much does tracing cost me in time and space?</h3>

<p>
Currently a traced program runs between 50-150 times slower than
its untraced counterpart, depending which compiler and options you
use.  We are working on reducing this factor.  As a rule of thumb,
a reduction step produces about 50 bytes in the trace file.  So trace
files can easily grow to tens and hundreds of megabytes. However,
you can name some modules of your program as <em>trusted</em>, so
that their reductions are not recorded in the trace.

<h3>I don't seem to be able to build Hat-2.02 with ghc-6.x</h3>

<p>
The hat-2.02 package is quite old now and does not build cleanly with
ghc &ge; 6.0.  All the build problems with ghc-6.x are fixed in the
newer release hat-2.04.

<h3>I have trouble compiling my program for tracing.</h3>

<p>
Hat covers the complete Haskell'98 language and its libraries, or
at least that is the intention.  It also supports a few language
extensions, such as the FFI, multi-parameter type class, functional
dependencies, and so on.  First make sure that your program is suitable
for tracing with Hat [ check our <a href="feature-table.html">Feature
Summary</a> to see exactly which language extensions are supported ],
and if it still won't compile, report it as a bug in Hat.

<h3>Compiling for tracing gives me an error like: Ambiguous type
variable `a' in top-level constraint `Num a'</h3>

<p>
You have been hit by Haskell's defaulting rules for numeric literals,
which unfortunately means you need to add one or more type signatures
to your code.  In the rejected module, add the line "default ()",
and recompile it normally (not for tracing).  You will now see an
error of similar form to the error you saw when compiling for tracing,
except that the line number refers to your original code.  Fix this
error by adding a type signature, e.g. (0::Int) instead of just 0.
Now if your original code compiles cleanly again, it will also compile
properly for tracing.

<h3>hat-trans fails with an error like: Cannot handle field update with
more than 2 labels; attempted arity 11</h3>

<p>
Hat has some numeric limits on the size of certain constructs it
can handle.  Usually, there is a simple syntactic change you can make
to your original source code to get round the limitation.  For instance:
<ul>
<li> <em>Field updates.</em> You can re-write a large field update
  to become a chain of smaller field updates, each with no more than
  two labels.  e.g. change <pre>x { a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4, e=5 }</pre>
  to <pre>x { a=1, b=2 } { c=3, d=4 } { e=5 }</pre>

<li> <em>Large applications.</em> You can re-write a large function or
  constructor application using parentheses to become a chain of smaller
  nested applications, each with no more than the stated arity.  e.g. change
  <pre>f a b c d e g h i j k</pre> to <pre>(((f a b c d) e g h i) j k</pre>
</ul>
