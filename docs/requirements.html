<hr>
<h3>You will need...</h3>
<p>
To build and use Hat, you will need
<ul>
<li> a Haskell'98 compiler that supports the standard FFI (i.e.
     <a href="http://www.haskell.org/nhc98/">nhc98</a> or
     <a href="http://www.haskell.org/ghc/">ghc</a>)
<li> the <a href="http://www.haskell.org/hmake/">hmake</a> compilation manager
<li> GNU make
<li> a C compiler (usually gcc)
<li> at least 128Mb of memory (256Mb with ghc -O)
<li> disk space: 30Mb (nhc98), 50Mb (ghc)
</ul>
Here are the minimum versions of software that we recommend: anything
earlier than these is unlikely to interoperate correctly with Hat-2.04.

<p>
You only need one Haskell compiler - the Hat installation procedure
will detect what you already have and use it.  However, it is
absolutely essential that you have <em>hmake</em>.  Not only is it
needed to build the various Hat tools, but you will also need it when
you want to build tracing versions of your own programs.

<p>
You must also have a Unix-like operating system environment with
X windows, in particular the <em>resize</em> command, and the
<em>xterm</em> terminal emulator supporting ANSI colour codes.  This is
used when you start one browsing tool from within another, to bring
up a new text window.  If you are using the Windows operating system,
then <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> is the appropriate
environment to use - it includes the eXceed X-server.  For MacOS X,
you should install the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/x11/">Apple
XFree86</a> server, or an equivalent.

<p>
If you do not have <em>gcc</em> as your C compiler, you will need to
ensure that your <em>CC</em> environment variable is set to the name
of your C compiler at the configuration stage.  For instance,
<pre>    CC=cc   ./configure --buildwith=...</pre>

<p>
The browsing tools may use the <em>glib</em> C library, which is
related to the larger <em>gtk+</em> set of libraries.  If it is
available, the automatic configuration of Hat will detect and use it.
(If it is not available, our own replacement code will be used,
but it is slightly slower.)  If glib is available, it is important
that you have version glib-1.2.x (although you may also have another
version glib-2.0.x installed simultaneously).  The latest version
in the 1.2.x series is <em>glib-1.2.10</em>, and it is available
from <a href="ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/gtk/v1.2/">ftp.gtk.org</a>.

<h3>GHC requirements</h3>
<p>
If you have <em>ghc</em>, then a <em>package</em> is built, containing
various Hat libraries.  The installation procedure attempts to
install the new `hat' package in the system directories that belong
to <em>ghc</em>.  You must have the appropriate permissions to write
into those directories, and sufficient permissions to update the
system-wide <em>ghc</em> package configuration.  (The installation
and configuration is performed automatically.)

<h3>nhc98 requirements</h3>
<p>
If you have <em>nhc98</em>, then a <em>package</em> is built, containing
various Hat libraries.  The installation procedure attempts to
install the new `hat' package in the system directories that belong
to <em>nhc98</em>.  You must have the appropriate permissions to write
into those directories.  (The installation is performed automatically.)
