<p>
The latest stable release is 2.06.  The CVS development tree is now
at version 2.07.  Bugfixes and important changes to the system are
described here for the two most recent released versions.

<p>

<hr>
<h3>Hat 2.06 (2008-10-02) features</h3>
<ul>
<li> New tool: hat-delta (debugging by comparison of traces).
<li> New tool: pretty-hat (displays a graph of the trace itself).
<li> Improved: hat-detect (algorithmic debugging).
<li> Improved: detection of ghc version under MacOS X.
<li> Improved: no longer need admin rights to install the Hat libraries for ghc.
<li> Bugfix: hat-trans: copes with literate files .lhs.
<li> Bugfix: hat-trans: FFI foreign imports now work.
<li> Bugfix: hat-trans: better handling of relative directory paths.
<li> Bugfix: hat-trans: largest size of a named-field update increased
                        from 2 to 10.
<li> Bugfix: hat-trans: top-level pattern-bindings now work.
<li> Bugfix: hat-trans: name clashes from 'deriving' clauses eliminated.
<li> Bugfix: libraries: correct printing of floating point numbers.
</ul>

<hr>
<h3>Hat 2.04 (2005-05-17) features</h3>
<ul>
<li> We have included more libraries from the hierarchical base package as
     standard, so more programs should be immediately traceable.
<li> The algorithmic debugging technique has been re-instated with
     the resurrection of the <em>hat-detect</em> browser.
<li> The browsers are better integrated with each other, sharing a common
     set of commands and options.
<li> A new browser, <em>hat-anim</em> is provided.  It animates the
     reduction sequence of a selected expression, showing the lazy evaluation
     strategy, and revealing intermediate calls between application and result.
<li> The new browser <em>hat-explore</em> allows interactive exploration of
     the trace with simultaneous source highlighting, to narrow down the
     location of a bug through program-slicing.
<li> Some new non-interactive tools: <em>hat-cover</em> shows the test
     coverage of the source code for a traced program run;
     <em>hat-nonterm</em> finds the circular set of definitions that causes
     a program to fall into a non-terminating loop.
<li> A significant performance improvement in the speed of running traced code.
<li> Many small bugfixes for correctness of the transformation.
<li> Works fully with ghc-6.2 and ghc-6.4
</ul>

<hr>
<h3>Hat 2.02 (2003-03-26) features</h3>
<ul>
<li> New:	Hat supports hierarchical module namespaces, and
		the distribution includes a tracing version of (a subset of) the
		<em>base</em> package of standard hierarchical libraries.
<li> New:	Hat supports multi-parameter type classes and functional
		dependencies, provided your underlying compiler supports them
		(i.e. ghc).
<li> New:	The browsing tools support qualified name syntax.
<li> Performance: The speed of traced programs is now much improved.  There
		is a new "known-arity" optimisation within Hat itself, which
		gives a speed-up of ~20-40%.  Also, if you use --buildwith=-O
		when configuring Hat for ghc, you will get another 20-40%
		improvement.  Beware however that -O requires a <em>lot</em>
		of memory (&ge;512Mb).
<li> Bugfix: Named field constructions and updates are now displayed in
             the browsing tools as named fields.
<li> Bugfix: The viewing tools displayed some sugared lists misleadingly:
             when the tail of a sugared list was cut off or undefined it
             was shown as if it was a final element.  Now it has an
             ellipsis (...) to indicate possible extra elements.
<li> Bugfix: After <em>:set recursive off</em> hat-observe showed the
             non-recursive calls of f even if given the application
             pattern <em>f in f</em>.
<li> Bugfix: hat-observe :info counts did not necessarily match
             the number of observations if there were partial or
             super-saturated applications.
<li> Bugfix: hat-trail now works correctly in environments (e.g. Solaris)
             that do not have <tt>stty cbreak</tt> mode.
<li> Bugfix: Scrolling sometimes blanked the upper part of the hat-trail
             display when the trace was extended deeper than the window.
<li> Bugfix: The hat-trail display became corrupted if a single trail
             expression or equation was large enough to scroll off the screen.
<li> Bugfix: Hat-trans generated wrongly-parenthesised code for some
             lambda expressions.
<li> Bugfix: Hat-trans generated incorrect values for some non-printing
             characters.
<li> Tidyup: For consistency, the :observe command within hat-observe now
             starts a fresh hat-observe window.  Also, in hat-trail, if
             if you give a query pattern to the :observe command, it now uses
             that as the first query, instead of the currently highlighted
             function.
<li> Numerous other small bugfixes in the various trace browsing tools.
</ul>

<h3>Hat 2.00 (2002-06-14) features</h3>
<ul>
<li> The first version released separately from nhc98.  It uses
     a different file format to store the trace, and the browsing
     tools have been completely rewritten to improve performance,
     integration, and correctness.
</ul>


<hr>

<h3>Status of various components</h3>

<p>
The basic components of <em>hat</em> are:
<ul>
   <li> hat-trans, the program transformer.
   <li> hat-lib, the runtime library that is linked to a transformed program.
   <li> hat-observe, a browser driven by expression patterns.
   <li> hat-trail, a browser driven by backward exploration.
   <li> hat-detect, a browser implementing algorithmic debugging. (NOT INCLUDED)
   <li> hat-stack, a browser showing a back-trace from an error.
   <li> hat-view, a source-code viewer.
   <li> hat-check, to verify the integrity of a .hat file.
</ul>
