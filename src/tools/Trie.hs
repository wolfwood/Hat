-- | A Trie is a lookup structure for strings of tokens.
-- * Any path through the Trie that terminates in a Found constructor
--   indicates that the string represented by that path is stored.
-- * A path that goes through a FoundAnd constructor indicates that
--   the prefix (up to FoundAnd) is definitely stored, and possibly
--   its continuation also.
-- * Any path or partial path that does not end with either a Found
--   or FoundAnd, means that the corresponding string is not stored.
